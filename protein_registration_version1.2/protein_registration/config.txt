This config file should be kept in the same directory as the protein_registration executable.

The program currently will only read the first 5 lines of the config file.
Please make sure there is no leading and ending spaces, etc in the first 5 lines.
An example of the first five lines is given below:

/Users/xinsui/CLionProjects/protein_registration/dataset/2.test_dataset/1.10
result.txt
10
100
50

The first line is the directory where the protein data are.
    If the "protein_names.txt" file exists in that directory, the program will compare all proteins in the file.
    Otherwise, the program will automatically scan all .pdb/.asa files in the directory, and build a protein_names.txt file containing all the scanned files.
    It is ok to modify the lines of the protein_names.txt without keeping the first column of the file (the index) continuous.
    For example, one can delete some lines in the file so that those will not be included in the calculation.
    Try to use absolute path in this line. Relative paths have not been tested.
    To retrieve the absolute path of a folder, use command 'cd' to go to that folder, then use command 'pwd' (Print Working Directory) to retrieve its absolute path.

The second line is the name of the file that output will be written to. ( Output will be at the directory of the first line.)
    The output is a matrix whose (i,j)th element is the distance between the ith and jth proteins.
    The result will be given in a upper-triangular matrix, which means the bottom-left half is always 0.
    The ith protein's name can be referenced from the ith line in the protein_names.txt.

The third line is the number of 3D points in the protein data.
    I will try to get this number from the data itself in later versions, but make sure it is modified when you use protein data with different representative points.

The fourth line is the dSSD cutoff value. 100 is a typical one.
The fifth line is the SSD cufoff value. 50 is a typical one.
